  <h1>MaybeReal – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 2025-12-07</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how 3DATA ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the
    MaybeReal mobile application (the "App").
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Account and contact information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address and/or authentication identifiers (for login and account management).</li>
    <li>Basic profile information if you sign in with a third-party provider (e.g. Apple, Google), as allowed by that provider.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Content you upload</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Images and other media that you upload to use the App’s features (enhancement, upscaling, filters, etc.).</li>
    <li>Derived data generated from your images (AI outputs, thumbnails, processing metadata).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Usage data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Technical information: device model, operating system version, app version, approximate timestamps of use.</li>
    <li>Logs related to errors, crashes, or performance issues.</li>
    <li>Non-identifying information about how you use the App (which screens are used, which features are triggered, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate the App’s core features (image enhancement, upscaling, filters, etc.).</li>
    <li>Authenticate you and secure your account.</li>
    <li>Store your generated content so you can view and download it.</li>
    <li>Monitor performance, detect bugs, and improve the App.</li>
    <li>Prevent abuse, spam, and misuse of the service.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-party services</h2>
  <p>We rely on third-party providers to operate the App:</p>

  <h3>3.1 Supabase</h3>
  <p>
    We use Supabase for our backend services, database, authentication, and storage. Your account data, some logs, and your images
    may be stored and processed on Supabase infrastructure.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 AI service providers</h3>
  <p>
    We use external AI service providers to process your images (for example: enhancement, upscaling, restoration, colorization,
    and other AI transformations). For this purpose, your images (or a compressed/processed version) and minimal related metadata
    are sent to their servers so that they can generate the requested results.
  </p>
  <p>
    These providers may operate servers in other countries (including outside the European Union). We configure these services so
    that your images are not used for their own training or marketing purposes when such options are available.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Legal bases (if you are in the EU/EEA)</h2>
  <p>We process your personal data based on the following legal grounds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract</strong>: to provide the App and its features to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong>: to secure our services, prevent abuse, and improve the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong>: where required (for example, for optional features or certain types of analytics or notifications).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account data is kept for as long as your account remains active.</li>
    <li>Uploaded images and generated content may be retained for a limited time so that you can access and download them. We may delete them periodically or when storage is no longer needed.</li>
    <li>Logs and technical data are kept only as long as necessary for troubleshooting, security, and improving the service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. However, no online service can be 100%
    secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your rights</h2>
  <p>If you are in the EU/EEA or in a similar jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
    <li>Request correction or deletion of your data.</li>
    <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
    <li>Request data portability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can exercise these rights by contacting us at <a href="mailto:maybereal.app@gmail.com">maybereal.app@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your country). We do not knowingly
    collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can
    delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>9. International transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Because our third-party providers may be located in other countries, your data may be transferred and processed outside your
    country of residence. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards for such transfers.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the "Last updated" date above and, where appropriate,
    inform you within the App.
  </p>

    If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or about how we handle your data, you can contact us at:
