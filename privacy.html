  <h1>MaybeReal – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-18</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how 3DATA ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the
    MaybeReal mobile application (the "App").
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Account and authentication information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address and/or authentication identifiers (for login and account management).</li>
    <li>Basic profile information if you sign in with a third-party provider (e.g., Apple, Google), as allowed by that provider.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Content you upload and generated content</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Images and other media that you upload to use the App's features (enhancement, upscaling, filters, colorization, etc.).</li>
    <li>Generated outputs produced by the App (processed images, thumbnails/previews).</li>
    <li>Technical processing metadata needed to run the service (e.g., request identifiers, processing status, timestamps).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Face data (images containing faces)</h3>
  <p>
    The App may process images that contain a face to apply visual effects (filters, enhancement, upscaling, colorization, alignment, artistic transformations).
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>What we collect:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Images uploaded by you that may contain faces. The "face data" is the image content itself.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> extract, create, or store separate biometric identifiers (such as face templates, embeddings, or faceprints).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>How we use face data:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Solely to apply visual effects and AI transformations requested by you.</li>
    <li>If face detection is used (e.g., for alignment or positioning), any derived data (bounding boxes, landmarks) is used only during real-time processing and is <strong>not stored</strong>.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use face data to identify or authenticate any person.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use face data for advertising, marketing, or user profiling.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Sharing:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Images containing faces are shared with our AI processing providers (Fal.ai, Replicate, ByteDance) solely to perform the requested transformations. See Section 3.3 for details.</li>
    <li>Face data is <strong>never</strong> shared for advertising, marketing, or profiling purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Storage and retention:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uploaded images are stored temporarily in Supabase Storage using time-limited signed URLs.</li>
    <li>Uploaded images are retained for <strong>up to 1 hour</strong>, then automatically deleted.</li>
    <li>Generated results are retained for <strong>up to 24 hours</strong>, then automatically deleted.</li>
    <li>We do not retain face data beyond these timeframes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.4 Purchase and subscription information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions.</li>
    <li>RevenueCat receives a unique anonymous user identifier to track your subscription status.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> receive or store your full payment card details. Payments are processed by Apple (App Store) or Google (Play Store).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.5 Usage and device data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Technical information: device model, operating system version, app version, approximate timestamps of use.</li>
    <li>Non-identifying information about how you use the App (e.g., which features are triggered).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
