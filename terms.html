  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these rules.</p>

  <h2>6. Paid features and in-app purchases</h2>

      payment partners.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Third-party services</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses third-party services such as Supabase (backend, database, storage) and external AI service providers for
    image processing. Your use of the App may therefore be subject to their terms and policies as well.

    purposes, in accordance with these Terms.

  <h2>9. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
  <p>
    The App is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted,
    or that it will meet all of your expectations. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or
    implied, including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, 3DATA will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
    or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, or revenues, arising out of or related to your use of the App.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Termination</h2>

    We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms or
    that your use may cause harm to us, other users, or third parties. You may stop using the App and delete it from your device at
    any time.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to the Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you within the App or by other
    reasonable means. Your continued use of the App after the changes become effective means you accept the new Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Governing law</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms are governed by the laws of your country of residence, unless local laws provide otherwise and must prevail.
